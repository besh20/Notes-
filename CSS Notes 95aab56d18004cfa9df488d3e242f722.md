- **CSS Selector**
    - Simple selectors (select elements based on name, id, class)
    - Pseudo-class selectors  (select elements based on a certain state)
    - Pseudo-element selectors (select and style a part of an element)
    - Atrribute-selector  (select elements based on an attribute or attribute value)
    
          Combinator selector  (select elements based on a specific relationship between them)
    
1. **CSS how to** 

• External CSS

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="mystyle.css">
</head>
<body>

<h1>This is a heading</h1>
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>

</body>
</html>
```

• Internal CSS

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
body {
  background-color: linen;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<h1>This is a heading</h1>
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>

</body>
</html>
```

• Inline CSS

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>
<h1 style="color:blue;text-align:center;">This is a heading</h1>
<p style="color:red;">This is a paragraph.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

- **CSS Box Model**
    
    The CSS box model is essentially a box that wraps around every HTML element. It consists of: content, padding, borders and margins. The image below illustrates the box model:
    
    - **Content** - The content of the box, where text and images appear
    - **Padding** - Clears an area around the content. The padding is transparent
    - **Border** - A border that goes around the padding and content
    - **Margin** - Clears an area outside the border. The margin is transparent
1. **CSS padding and margins** 

 Margins: create space around elements, outside of any defined borders.

```html
p {
  margin-top: 100px;
  margin-bottom: 100px;
  margin-right: 150px;
  margin-left: 80px;
}
```

 Padding: generate space around an element's content, inside of any defined borders.

```html
div {
  padding-top: 50px;
  padding-right: 30px;
  padding-bottom: 50px;
  padding-left: 80px;
}
```

- **CSS colors**
    - **RGB Value**
    
    **rgb(*red,* *green*, *blue*)**
    
    Each parameter (red, green, and blue) defines the intensity of the color between 0 and 255.
    
    For example, rgb(255, 0, 0) is displayed as red, because red is set to its highest value (255) and the others are set to 0.
    
    - **RGBA Value**
    
    **rgba(*red,* *green*, *blue, alpha*)**
    
    The alpha parameter is a number between 0.0 (fully transparent) and 1.0 (not transparent at all)
    
    - **HEX Value**
    
    **#*rrggbb***
    
    Where rr (red), gg (green) and bb (blue) are hexadecimal values between 00 and ff (same as decimal 0-255).
    
- **CSS Pseudo-classes**
    
    A pseudo-class is used to define a special state of an element.
    
    For example, it can be used to:
    
    - Style an element when a user mouses over it(:hover)
    - Style visited and unvisited links differently
    - Style an element when it gets focus
    
    **The :first-child Pseudo-class;** The `:first-child` pseudo-class matches a specified element that is the first child of another element.
